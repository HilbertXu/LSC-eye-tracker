# LSC eye-tracker (Learning Single Camera Eye-Tracker)
This repo is for eye track research

We are in the process of preparing dataset for free public release now.
## Data generation
* `generate-dataset.py` generate .npz data package for training from the MPIIFaceGaze dataset. Use `python generate-dataset.py <dataset folder (e.g., ./p00)> <saved .npz file name>`
## Model training
* `i2g_g_v1.0.py` previous code for model training, use matlab data file as input. Use `python i2g_g_v1.0.py <.mat data file (v7.3)> | tee <logfile>.txt`
* `i2g_train.py` train the model with .npz dataset generated by `generate-dataset.py`, save model file .h5. Use `python i2g_train.py <.npz data file name> <model name for saving> [<for continuously training model file .h5>]`
## Model prediction and visualing the results
* `predict-gaze.py` predict gaze point and display both the orginal image and gaze point with trained model .h5 and file list .txt. Use `python predict-gaze.py <trained model file .h5> <file list file .txt (e.g., p00.txt)>`
## Standard
* Python code should follow Google style
