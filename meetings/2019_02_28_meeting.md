### 1. Layer visualization

​	See ./visualization

### 2. Kernel visualization(Unfinished)

​	This part will try to rebuild our model with Pytorch and use Pytorch's API to Visualize the kernel

### 3. Modified codes

​	Now we can automatically read the screen size from .mat file and generate all person's data to .npz files

### 4. Deconvolution codes

​	Because of the irreversible of MaxPooling operation, i decided to use the:

`tf.nn.conv2d_transpose` to do deconvolution operation on the output of first conv2d layer(layer0)

​	And see ./visualization
